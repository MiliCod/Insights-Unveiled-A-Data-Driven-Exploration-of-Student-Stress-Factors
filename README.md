# Student Stress Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This data science project aims to comprehensively analyze student stress factors using machine learning techniques. We will leverage the dataset "Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis," which provides a wealth of information about students, including personal, academic characteristics, and other factors linked to stress.

## Hypotheses

### 1. Sleep Quality and Student Stress

We hypothesize a positive correlation between sleep quality and student stress. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep is commonly believed to have detrimental effects on cognitive function, emotional well-being, and overall physical health, potentially leading to increased stress levels, particularly in demanding academic environments.

### 2. Living Conditions and Stress

Furthermore, we speculate that living conditions play a significant role in determining stress levels. Unfavorable conditions, such as noise disturbances, lack of personal space, or concerns about safety, might exacerbate feelings of stress and anxiety among students.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

Utilizing the "Student Stress Factors" dataset, we gather crucial information to understand the various aspects influencing student stress.

### 2. Data Exploration (Unit 2: Statistical Learning)

Before diving into modeling, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to gain insights into the structure, distribution, and potential correlations within the dataset. This step involves identifying missing values, outliers, and establishing relationships between variables.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

The data will undergo cleaning processes, with a focus on managing missing values and outliers. Categorical variables will be encoded for better compatibility with machine learning models, and necessary normalization or scaling will be applied.

### 4. Machine Learning Techniques

#### a. Supervised Learning

   - Regression models will be employed to predict stress levels based on different features.
   - Classification models (e.g., Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) will be explored for categorical outcomes (stressed/not stressed).

#### b. Unsupervised Learning

   - Clustering techniques like K-means will be utilized to segment students into groups based on stress factors.

#### c. Regression (Unit 5: Regression)

   - Various regression techniques, both linear and non-linear, will be explored to understand how different criteria influence student stress levels.

#### d. Neural Networks (Unit 9: Neural Networks)

   - Advanced neural network models will be applied for both regression and classification tasks.

### 5. Model Evaluation

The performance of the developed models will be assessed using relevant metrics such as RMSE for regression and precision/F1-score for classification.

### 6. Results Interpretation

Following model training, we will identify the criteria having the greatest impact on student stress.

### 7. Visualization

Charts and visualizations will be created to illustrate the relationships between different criteria and student stress levels.

### 8. Recommendations and Actions

Based on our findings, recommendations will be formulated to help alleviate student stress by focusing on the identified criteria. The goal is to provide actionable insights for educational institutions and students to enhance well-being and academic success.

## Milestone: End of Second Month

By the end of the second month, our goals include:

- Completion of data preprocessing.
- Execution of initial models to obtain baseline results.
- Identification of primary stress factors based on feature importance from preliminary models.

This milestone will set the foundation for refining our models and conducting advanced analyses in subsequent phases.
